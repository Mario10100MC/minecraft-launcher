# Minecraft Batch Launcher
This is a simple script to launch Minecraft without an official launcher

## What is?
* To run the required version of the game, from any directory and settings
* To create your assemblies (adaptation and binary launcher)
* To run Minecraft without a license (for testing servers)

The absence of the need to compile the launcher allows you to change parameters on the fly simply by editing the `* .bat` file.
