# Installation

## Preparing for installation
First of all, you must have already downloaded Minecraft with the required version of the game.
A **Demo** account is enough for this.

?> Download Minecraft free [link](https://www.minecraft.net/ru-ru/free-trial).

## Running Launcher
First of all, download the [launcher](https://github.com/iiiypuk/minecraft-launcher/releases) and unpack it into the Minecraft directory.

- Windows default path `%appdata%\.minecraft`
- Linux default path `~/.minecraft`

?> The current version of the launcher is set to launch the latest stable version of the game.

Next, you need the binaries of the libraries.
Archives of binary versions are stored in the cloud on **MEGA** [[Download](https://mega.nz/#F!hUNg0Y6I!93cYw1NZg4MUWUHaVrCO7w)].
To start, you just need to unpack the archive with libraries into the `/ bin /` directory and remove from the file name
`-windows` or `-linux` word.

Libraries can be generated [by himself](#Generating-binary-libraries).

?> The current version of the launcher is always found at this [link](https://github.com/iiiypuk/minecraft-launcher/releases/latest).

## Generating binary libraries
?> If you downloaded binary libraries, skip this step.

Binary libraries are generated when the game is started in the `/ bin /` directory and are removed after the game is closed.
The directory with binaries has the following name `d3ab-9be2-0b09-1052`, which changes every time.

To save them, you need to start the game and copy the directory.

## Complete
If you plan to run the current stable version of the game, nothing needs to be configured. Just double click on `mc_start.*` And enjoy the game.

In other cases, you need to familiarize yourself with the [variables](variables) of the script.
